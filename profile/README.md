# Wuduh  

Wuduh is a Chrome extension that adapts web content in real time to each reader’s level. By adjusting vocabulary, sentence structure, and explanations on the fly, it makes online reading more accessible for ESL learners, students, and neurodivergent readers.  

## Why Wuduh  
Too much online content is written above the average comprehension level. Existing tools oversimplify or require constant manual effort. Wuduh takes a different approach: it learns from how you read and continuously adapts, offering support that feels natural instead of forced.  

## What It Does  
- Simplifies text with one click  
- Offers adjustable reading levels  
- Provides vocabulary definitions on hover  
- Remembers your preferences across sites  

## Looking Ahead  
Wuduh’s vision is to become the **Grammarly of reading** — a tool that not only makes content easier to understand, but also helps people grow their skills over time.
